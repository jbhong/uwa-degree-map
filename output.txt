Unit Incompatibility: CITS5504 Data Warehousing

Unit Description    : Relational databases are the backbones of modern businesses in processing transactions and storing customer data. Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP.

Unit Description    : Natural Language has been and will remain as the most preferred way to store and transfer knowledge. More than 80% of electronic data in modern societies are generated and stored in textual format. How to process unstructured text to extract useful insights and support actionable decision making and discover the hidden treasure of collective intelligence is of enormous value. In this unit, we start with traditional text processing techniques using Regular Expressions and discuss the needs of text processing and normalisation. We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.  The unit situates the techniques around major NLP tasks, including information extraction, sentiment detection, dialogue systems and machine translation.

Unit Outcomes       : Students are able to (1) apply pre-processing techniques for textual data preparation; (2) build pipelines for core NLP tasks; (3) critically analyse different language models; (4) explain how vector representations of words can be obtained; (5) evaluate performance of NLP solutions, both traditional and neural; and (6) undertake core components of major NLP tasks.

Unit Description    : Computer vision is the science of automatically computing information and making decisions from an observed image, image set or an image sequence. It combines concepts from 'image processing' (in the spatial and frequency domains) and 'pattern recognition'. Computer vision has a wide number of potential applications, including satellite imaging, control and measurement, industrial inspection, surveillance (e.g. face recognition) and medical applications. This unit covers topics such as binary image analysis, greyscale image manipulation, linear and nonlinear filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, image segmentation and recognition. It also covers camera calibration and projective geometry and how three-dimensional information can be reconstructed from single images, stereo pairs of images and motion sequences. In the future, it is anticipated that computer vision systems will become prevailing, and that vision technology will be more applied across a broad range of business and consumer products. This will result in a strong industry demand for computer vision engineers—for people who understand vision technology and know how to apply it in real-world problems.

Unit Outcomes       : Students are able to (1) explain computer vision problems in writing; (2) write MATLAB code to solve computer vision problems; (3) describe the theories and principles in computer vision; (4) conduct independent research on a chosen research topic, write a small research report, and give an oral presentation; (5) demonstrate logical thinking and problem-solving skills; (6) process images in both the spatial and frequency domains; (7) explain the technical theory behind formation of images; and (8) critique various methodologies for solving problems in computer vision and image processing.
